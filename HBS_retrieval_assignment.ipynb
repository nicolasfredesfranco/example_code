    "- We apply tokenization and text preprocessing.\n",
    "- We **fit** the TF–IDF vectorizer on these product documents:\n",
    "  - this fixes the vocabulary $V = \\{t_1, \\dots, t_{|V|}\\}$,\n",

    "First, we need to analyze the data, particularly the product data, because the actual queries might differ from the query dataset, but the potential products and their characteristics are static in this case. This allows us to extract descriptive information about the necessary latent space, such as its minimum dimensions, using an information theory approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why, if we choose to represent products and queries in the same n-dimensional space, as is the case with TF-IDF, where the dimensional length is the number of words in the vocabulary, the most reasonable approach is to define this space based on the product data and, once defined, proceed to adjust the rest. In this way, we will analyze how much we can compress the product information, which features we will use, and how we will represent them to avoid distortion. Once we know the optimal representation for the products, we can define this as our latent space and implement the necessary changes to the queries to embed them in that space and perform our comparison. The idea will be to find a minimal dimension space, properly designed to maintain the semantic properties of the texts once embedded."

    "We discarded `rating_count` and `review_count` as features to consider for representing products, since, being numerical characteristics of how often a product is visited or viewed, they don't provide information about the semantic characteristics that describe the object. Therefore, they wouldn't be useful for better matching with the queries. Furthermore, as we've already observed, these two columns are practically zero for most of the data. They are both highly concentrated at zero, so they would provide information about very few products, even if we were interested in including them for the ranking information they represent. Since they don't carry semantic information, one way to include them would be to have the search engine first consider the products with the most views or ranking, but since this is so concentrated, it would discard too many products, so this option is ultimately discarded."

However, for our current task, we are interested in features that describe the semantic content of the product (i.e., what the product actually is), not just metrics of popularity or user engagement. The `average_rating` does not provide semantic information about the product itself; it simply reflects how satisfied users were on average, which could be influenced by many factors unrelated to semantic similarity with a query.\n",

    "A simple visual analysis reveals that the `product_features` column exhibits excessive diversity, with inconsistent elements and lengths across products. Each product has its own list of features with its own values, making its representation extremely difficult. Furthermore, its excessive length compared to the `product_description` column could overshadow it. It's worth noting that, from an information theory perspective, variables capable of having too many meanings are considered uninformative. Therefore, just as a column with only identical values ​​(i.e., with a single possible value) is uninformative, so too is a column with too many possible values, or even one where each row has a different value. With practically as many possible values ​​as rows, a probability distribution estimate would yield something quite close to a uniform distribution. From information theory, we know that given a certain domain, this is the distribution that minimizes entropy, making it the least informative and contributing the least to the product's representation. It is for all these reasons that we also discard the `product_description` column."

    "Since both entropy values are close to 8 bits, for simplicity we will consider them both as 8. Therefore, from information theory, we know that each of these two columns can be compressed to its maximum entropy by Shannon's theorem. That is, the most compact way to represent each value is an array of 8 values that are either 1 or 0. This is the maximum compression we can apply without losing information. Now, it is trivial to observe that the information contained in an array of 8 float values between 0 and 1 or between -1 and 1, and in general, an array of 8 elements with floating-point values, contains the same information and more. Therefore, we can conclude that a representation of an array of 8 floating-point values would be more than sufficient to represent each of these two columns."

    "We have managed to represent each of the products as a vector of 216 elements and each query from the dataset or any future query as a vector of 200 elements. The processing of the query, particularly the use of transform, is only done after having fit the model to the product data, which in practice is the only data set we will always have. Now, the only thing left is to implement a linear layer that allows us to map the 200-dimensional query vectors to vectors of length 216. After this mapping, and after applying the multiplication and the sigmoid function, the output is normalized using the norm of each vector. Then, we optimize to minimize cosine distance as much as possible. Since all the vectors involved are normalized, the cosine of the angle can be calculated as the dot product between the vectors. Cosine similarity indicates a match when the result is 1, and a poor match when it is -1, so the optimization process will use Adam to maximize the dot product or equivalently minimize 1 - cosine distance. All of this will be conducted using the minimum necessary number of layers on GPU and training will be done using cross-validation. Remember to use the already embedded and normalized data for both the queries and the products, and remember that the mapping between them is defined in the labels. Once the layer will be train we could used it to map any new query to some product."

    "   - Result: 216-dimensional semantic representation (8 + 8 + 200)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Spell checking to correct typos\n",
    "   - Stop word removal\n",

    "   - Compression from 44,307 to 200 dimensions\n",
    "   - Extracts most important semantic properties\n",
    "   - Reduces noise and computation complexity\n",
    "   - Result: More compact and meaningful representations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deep Learning Neural Network**\n",
    "   - 2-layer architecture (200 → 256 → 216) with Tanh activations\n",
    "   - Custom loss: 1 - cosine similarity\n",
    "   - Two-phase training strategy\n",

    "### How Each Improvement Potentially Increases MAP@10:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Better semantic product representations improve matching accuracy\n",
    "- **Query Cleaning**: Corrects user errors, leading to better matches\n",

    "**Proposed Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of treating partial matches as irrelevant (penalizing too strictly), we can assign weighted scores based on the match type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exact match**: Score = 1.0\n",
    "- **Partial match**: Score = 0.5 \n",

    "**Justification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Less Strict Penalization**: Partial matches indicate the search is on the right track, even if not perfect\n",
    "2. **Intermediate Reward**: Distributes values equidistantly between irrelevant (0) and exact (1)\n",
    "3. **Better Gradient**: Gives clearer signal for model improvements\n",

    "**Tradeoffs:**\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Pro**: Encourages models to at least get close, even if not perfect\n",
